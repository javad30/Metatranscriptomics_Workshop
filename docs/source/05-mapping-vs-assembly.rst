Mapping vs Assembly
===================

Mapping-first
-------------

- Map reads directly to a reference gene catalog or genomes.
- Tools: Bowtie2, STAR.

Assembly-first
--------------

- Assemble transcripts and then annotate them.
- Tools: metaSPAdes, MEGAHIT.

Choose based on reference availability, novelty of the community, and compute budget.
